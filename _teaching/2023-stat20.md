As an undergraduate student instructor for a class of 90 in Introduction to Probability and Statistics (Stat 20), I utilized advanced statistical software, such as R, to help students master complex concepts and apply them to real-world scenarios. I facilitated weekly review sessions to reinforce key material and enhance students' understanding of the course. Additionally, I attended faculty meetings and collaborated with the professor and course instructors to ensure alignment with course objectives and maintain high academic standards.
