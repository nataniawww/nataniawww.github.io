I graduated with honors from UC Berkeley with a degree in Economics and Data Science. My senior honors thesis applied the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method to examine how language spoken at home impacts social mobility for first-generation immigrants in the United States. This research earned the 2024 Michael and Chris Boskin Scholarship. My interests lie at the intersection of data analysis and policy optimization, particularly in labor and public economics, with a focus on how policies shape social mobility and income inequality.

At the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment (IRLE), I worked under Professor Michael Reich, analyzing the effects of Californiaâ€™s new minimum wage policy on fast-food workers and exploring racial inequality's role in wage elasticity. Previously, at the San Diego County Taxpayers Association (SDCTA), I conducted policy and spatial analyses to evaluate tax revenue allocation. At the U.S. Arctic Research Commission (USARC), I identified collaborative projects across the eight Arctic States and gathered data on financial sponsors and stakeholders in research partnerships.

I also teach, run marathons, read, and knit!
